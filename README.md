# Linear Algebra Quick Review
These notes are served as a quick review of linear algebra knowledge. Main idea and core concepts are included.
While we already have many references in English, I would like to write some useful notes in chinese so more students in chinese can understand. However, I honestly suggest you read the original reference if you can, and that would be a good chance to improve your ability of reading materials in English.

Reference: Linear Algebra Done Right 3rd Edition, Introduction to Linear Algebra 5th Edition.

Two chapters are updated now and they are all in chinese.

Enjoy!
